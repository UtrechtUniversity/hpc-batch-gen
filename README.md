# batchgen
Package for generating simple batch scripts in HPC environments. Currently available: GNU Parallel, SLURM backend.

### Requirements:

##### Software

- GNU Parallel (for parallel backend)
- Python 2.7+

### Installation:

The easiest way to install the batchgen package is to use the following command in a terminal:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/hpc-batch-gen.git
```

Use the following in case you have no administrator access:

``` bash
pip install --user git+https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/hpc-batch-gen.git
```

### Usage
```bash
python -m batchgen command_file config_file [-pre run_pre_file] [-post run_post_file]
```

##### input_script
This is a script file that you want to run/parallelize. Every line should be a simple bash command (no backgrounding necessary).

##### config\_file
Configuration file for the job to be run in standard INI format. Readable by humans and configparser (Python) alike. Templates are available in the samples/ folder. For a detailed description of how to construct configuration files, see [here](config.md)

##### run\_pre\_file (optional)
This is code that is run on each of the nodes before the commands. Possible uses are: copying files to temporary directories, copying source files. Overridden by pre\_post\_file option in the configuration file.

##### run\_post\_file (optional)
This code is run on each of the nodes after the commands. Possible uses are: copying results back or removing unused data. Overridden by pre\_post\_file option in the configuration file.

### Example

First go to the samples directory:

```bash
cd samples
```

Then run the batch generator with the parallel backend (assuming the GNU parallel is installed):

```bash
python asr_batch.py x.csv params.csv parallel.ini
```

There should be a directory called "batch.parallel/my\_test/" in which a batch script called "batch.sh" is present.

Run the batch script:

```bash
batch.parallel/my_test/batch.sh
```
